## PROJECTS

**Corrective RAG | Langgraph, ChromaDB, Streamlit, Docker**  
[Source Code](https://github.com/)
- Engineered an innovative Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system utilising Langgraph for sophisticated agent workflow orchestration, improving information retrieval accuracy.
- [Live Demo](https://tanvir-corrective-rag.streamlit.app/)

**Retrieval Augmented Generation | Langchain, OpenAI, Pinecone**  
[Source Code](https://github.com/)
- Built information retrieval system using OpenAI GPT models with LangChain for pipeline orchestration and Pinecone for vector storage.
- Enhanced QA accuracy by coupling LLMs with external knowledge retrieval.

**Multi-Agent Recommendation System | AWS, Anthropic, Python**  
[Source Code](https://github.com/)
- Designed multi-agent system using AWS Bedrock with supervisor agent dynamically invoking collaborator agents.
- Utilized AWS Lambda for request processing and agent orchestration.
- Leveraged S3 buckets for efficient data storage and retrieval.

**ViT vs. CNN Image Classification | Scikit-learn, Pandas, PyTorch, Gradio**  
[Source Code](https://github.com/)
- Developed a custom Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch and rigorously compared its performance against a pre-trained EfficientNetB2 classifier on image classification tasks.
- Evaluated model accuracy, efficiency, and inference times, highlighting the trade-offs between self-implemented architectures and state-of-the-art pretrained models.
